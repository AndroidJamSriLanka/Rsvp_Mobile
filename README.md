# An android app for the RSVP website.

# App Discription
  RSVP is an event management website for Sri Lanka. It is still an under development website and it is for the companies who needs to publish their events and people who participate for that events.
  This will be a good chance for the people who are interested to participate for the events because they can check for the upcoming events and can register for that events easily.
  An android app will be very useful to people who needs to check events and register for the events.
